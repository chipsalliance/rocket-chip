\label{hartsel}
\index{hartsel}
        Throughout this document we refer to \Fhartsel, which is \Fhartselhi
        combined with \Fhartsello. While the spec allows for 20 \Fhartsel bits,
        an implementation may choose to implement fewer than that. The actual
        width of \Fhartsel is called {\tt HARTSELLEN}. It must be at least 0
        and at most 20. A debugger should discover {\tt HARTSELLEN} by writing
        all ones to \Fhartsel (assuming the maximum size) and reading back the
        value to see which bits were actually set. Debuggers must not change
        \Fhartsel while an abstract command is executing.

        \begin{commentary}
        There are separate \Fsetresethaltreq and \Fclrresethaltreq bits so that
        it is possible to write \Rdmcontrol without changing the halt-on-reset
        request bit for each selected hart, when not all selected harts have
        the same configuration.
        \end{commentary}

        On any given write, a debugger may only write 1 to at most one of the
        following bits: \Fresumereq, \Fhartreset, \Fackhavereset,
        \Fsetresethaltreq, and \Fclrresethaltreq. The others must be written 0.

\label{resethaltreq}
\index{resethaltreq}
        \Fresethaltreq is an optional internal bit of per-hart state that cannot be
        read, but can be written with \Fsetresethaltreq and \Fclrresethaltreq.
